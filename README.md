An Empirical Evaluation of Deep Learning-Based Source Code Vulnerability Detection: Representation vs. Models

Hi there, welcome to this page!


This page details the input, output and scripts used in the paper "An Empirical Evaluation of Deep Learning-Based Source Code Vulnerability Detection: Representation vs. Models
" by Donatello Sebastian Leslo, Wei Zheng, Xiaoxue Wu, Samuel Akwasi Agyemang, Tao Liu and  Yuan Ge.

Requirements for code:

Tensorflow
Keras
Scikit-learn
Word2Vec
Python >= 2.7



The project contains 3 main folders:

1. Input-Dataset: Contains the data used for the inputs of the neural network. This consists of the numerical vector representation of the input source code and its labels.

2. Scripts: Contains all the scripts used in the experiment, which consists of the code used to process the source code input files and the neural network models used for the experiment.

3. Output data: Consists of the output results for the neural network models.
